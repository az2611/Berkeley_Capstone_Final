## Executive Summary
Claims processing in insurance refers to the procedures and activities involved in receiving, verifying, and resolving claims filed by policyholders. This process typically includes reviewing the claim details, assessing coverage, investigating the circumstances surrounding the claim, and determining the amount of compensation to be paid.  
In most cases, claims descriptions present as open text, requiring classifying these into categories as it allows for easier organization and analysis. However, this is a challenging and time-consuming task often performed by hand, and requires specialized knowledge.  
We hypothesize we can automate the classification of claims descriptions. For this, we have evaluated a set of anonymized casualty loss descriptions within nine categories using three traditional machine-learning classification methods (Logistic regression, Decision tree, Naïve Bayes) and two pre-trained large language models (BERT, GPT-3) achieving accuracy above 90%.  
Initial results reported here are encouraging and should be considered exploratory, we suggest expanding work to refine these methods and develop models in more risk practices and specialties.
